# UI Refresh Progress

## Completed
- Simplified global color system to rely on a single brand variable with neutral supporting tones.
- Rebuilt navigation header with cleaner layout, status badge, and user chip.
- Redesigned sidebar keep list to a flat layout with full-width dividers and brand accent bar.
- Updated “New keep” interactions and loaders to use consistent palette and spacing.

## TODO
- Revisit hover/active accessibility contrast against various backgrounds.
- Unify empty/loading states across pages (icons + copy).
- Address existing React hook lint warnings (dependency arrays).
- Explore condensed desktop layout once dark mode strategy is defined.
